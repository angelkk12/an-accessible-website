# an-accessible-website
A Website That Meets Accessibility Standards.

This website was previously built for a marketing agency and they wanted a codebase that followed accessibility standards  so that the site would be optimized for search engines. 
I went in and added semantic HTML elements to ensure that the website had improved accessibility. The semantic HTML elements will enable users of assistive technologies such as screen readers to easily navigate and use the website. 

Whilst completing this project, I have had the opportunity to have a deeper dive into each semantic element used and how a lack of these elements can put alot of people at a disavantage.

 Furthermore, when researching why accessibilty was important, I was able to learn that in the UK, there is even legislation that oversees this, with the main one being the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) 2018 which requires the public sector bodies to comply with accessibility requirement to make a website or mobile app accesible by making it percievable,operable,understandable and robust. 
 
 This also fulfils the Equality Act 2010 guidelines that requires all UK service providers to consider reasonable adjustments for disabled people. This was the most interesting part for me that I didn't previously know about as websites that fail to meet these accessible standards have real life consequences. 

For example, when a blind student successfully brought legal action against the Student Loans Company (SLC) after it failed to failed to make a form on their website accessible to visually impaired people. 


Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

The project is a wbsite for now, and when deployed the users are able to use a URL link to access the improved webpage.

## Usage

Once the webpage has been opened, under the "Our Services" banner, you are able to navigate to each section of the page by clicking on the link. 


## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
