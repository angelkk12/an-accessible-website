A Website That Meets Accessibility Standards.

This website was previously built for a marketing agency and they wanted a codebase that followed accessibility standards  so that the site would be optimized for search engines. 
I went in and added semantic HTML elements to ensure that the website had improved accessibility. The semantic HTML elements will enable users of assistive technologies such as screen readers to easily navigate and use the website. 

Whilst completing this project, I have had the opportunity to have a deeper dive into each semantic element used and how a lack of these elements can put alot of people at a disavantage.

 Furthermore, when researching why accessibilty was important, I was able to learn that in the UK, there is even legislation that oversees this, with the main one being the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) 2018 which requires the public sector bodies to comply with accessibility requirement to make a website or mobile app accesible by making it percievable,operable,understandable and robust. 
 
 This also fulfils the Equality Act 2010 guidelines that requires all UK service providers to consider reasonable adjustments for disabled people. This was the most interesting part for me that I didn't previously know about as websites that fail to meet these accessible standards have real life consequences. 

For example, when a blind student successfully brought legal action against the Student Loans Company (SLC) after it failed to failed to make a form on their website accessible to visually impaired people.
